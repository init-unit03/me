# How to make a zettel entry

This is the body of the zettel (which means "slip")

* First Bullet
* Second Bullet

But, when I have an ordered or numbered list:

1. First
1. Second

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Prinln("Hello world!")
}
```

What if I want *italic* or **bold** or ***bolditalic***?

How about something that look like `code`?

* I put references at the bottom

    #zettel #notes
